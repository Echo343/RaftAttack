# RaftAttack
## Description
A mod for the game "Raft". This mod displays an indicator on the UI when the shark is attacking the raft.  Useful for larger rafts when you can't hear the shark chomping away.

## Useful Commands
* **offsetUIRaftAttack** - moves the UI indicator down a bit. Useful for if you have other mods that are utilizing the space.
* **attackRaftRaftAttack** - causes the shark to attack the raft.  This is more of a debugging command.

## Notes & Planned Updates
* The offset command is not persistent, meaning you'll have to enter the command every time you load the game.  In the future I have plans to persist this in a config file.
* With enough demand (or bordom and time on my part) I will add indicators for Seagulls, and when the shark is attacking the SharkBait.
